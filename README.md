# ConwayLife
A simple realization of Conway's game of life. All the credits go to @hahawoo - that's he taught me how to do such things.

## What is this?
Conway's Game of Life is very popular math model created in 1970s by John Conway.
You can find out more here - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life

## What are the rules?
There are several main rules in the game:
1. There are only two cell states - 'alive' or 'dead'.
2. A cell gets alive in case it has at least 3 alive neigbours.
3. A cell gets dead in case there are less than 3 alive neighbours.
4. The game finishes when there are no alive cells left.

## What was it written with?
The project was developed with Lua and Love2D framework. Main goal of project for me was to play around with Love2D a little - I liked it a lot.

## How to build?
Pretty simple! All the files from framework are already here.
Just clone the repository, create a folder with main.lua and move it on love.exe.
If you are on Linux or Mac, you can find needed package here - https://love2d.org/

## Some screenshots?
Of course! But just one - I am too lazy for more :(
